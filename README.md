ðŸ”¹ 1. Earnings Growth (Momentum Confirmation)
Key Ratios:

Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth (YoY or QoQ)

Revenue Growth Rate

Why It Matters:

Stocks with strong earnings growth often continue trending.

Earnings beats act as catalysts for price movements.

ðŸ“Œ Swing Trade Setup:

Look for a stock that had a strong earnings beat.

Enter after a pullback to a support level.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio (Valuation Check)
Why It Matters:

Helps avoid overvalued stocks that might be due for a correction.

Low P/E stocks with strong earnings growth may have room to run.

ðŸ“Œ Swing Trade Setup:

If a stock is breaking out but has an extremely high P/E, watch for a potential pullback.

If it has moderate P/E with strong growth, the uptrend may continue.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Beta (Volatility for Price Swings)
Why It Matters:

Swing traders need stocks that move (high beta = more volatility).

A stock with beta > 1.5 is more volatile than the market â†’ better for short-term trades.

ðŸ“Œ Swing Trade Setup:

High beta + bullish trend â†’ More potential upside.

High beta + overbought RSI â†’ Short-term pullback opportunity.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Average Trading Volume (Liquidity & Momentum)
Why It Matters:

High volume = easier entries/exits.

Sudden volume spikes confirm momentum.

ðŸ“Œ Swing Trade Setup:

Look for breakouts with increased volume to confirm trend strength.

Avoid low-volume stocks (spreads are wider, harder to trade).

ðŸ”¹ 5. Debt-to-Equity (Avoid Weak Companies)
Why It Matters:

High debt can make stocks vulnerable during market pullbacks.

Swing traders donâ€™t want to hold stocks that may crash due to bad financial health.

ðŸ“Œ Swing Trade Setup:

If two similar stocks are breaking out, choose the one with lower debt-to-equity for lower risk.
